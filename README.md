Vectorized QuickScorer
======================

**Vectorized QuickScorer** was designed by Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R. with the support of Tiscali S.p.A. 

Vectorized QuickScorer is an extension of QuickScorer to exploit SIMD capabilities of modern CPUs. The algorithm is presented in *Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.* **Exploiting CPU SIMD Extensions to Speed-up Document Scoring with Tree Ensembles.** *In SIGIR '16: Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (2016)*.

The QuickScorer algorithm is discussed in *Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.* **Quickscorer: a fast algorithm to rank documents with additive ensembles of regression trees.** *In SIGIR '15: Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (2015)*.

**QuickScorer** is undergoing a patent process. Title of invention: **A method to rank documents by a computer, using additive ensembles of regression trees and cache optimization, and search engine using such a method**, applicant *Tiscali S.p.A.*, inventors: *Dato, D., Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., and Venturini, R.*. International patent pending no. PCT29914.
